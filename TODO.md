# TODO

## Basic crap

 - Refactor message event handler into own service (scoped)
 - Dockerize the solution so it can be easily deployed on a node (still needs work but usable)


## Color commands

 - Help command for colorme & uncolorme as well as parent command

## Way too out of scope

 - Add generic help message to modules (use middleware to extract help string??)


## Feature suggestions:

 - Twitch stream notifs
 - UD
 - Hide/show text channels based on connected voice channel
 - Role commands
