# TODO

## Basic crap

 - Replace raw IConfiguration references with options
 - Refactor message event handler into own service (scoped)
 - Dockerize the solution so it can be easily deployed on a node


## Color commands

 - Help command for colorme & uncolorme as well as parent command

## Role commands

 - ...

## Way too out of scope

 - Add generic help message to modules (use middleware to extract help string??)
